With a background in Applied Mathematics and Physics, Josiah’s passion is for problem solving and optimization. His interest in data science came from learning to program and the landscape of problems that have yet to be solved.  

At work, Josiah’s interests are machine learning at scale, Neural Networks, and open source data science tooling. Josiah is also interested in and passionate about fostering the culture necessary to support data science.  

At home, Josiah enjoys brewing beer, cycling, and building things: anything that keeps him off the computer. You can usually find him at one of the many craft breweries on the weekend trying to start a chess game.
